## Introduction

Cubic Jumping is a platformer game. It's called "Cubic Jumping" because you play
as a cube, who jumps - very creative... The game is made with the aim of having
fun movement and level mechanics. Technically speaking, the game is quite
primitive, but I've tried to make the basic features come together in
interesting ways.

## Dependencies

* Make (for build, optional)
* mincbuild (for build, optional)
* SDL2
* SDL2 mixer
* MSYS2 with MinGW64 (for windows build)
* wget (for windows build setup)
* unzip (for windows build setup)

## Management

* If on Windows, navigate to `windows-build/` and run `./setup.sh` under
  MSYS2/MinGW64 in order to set up the build
* To build the program, run `make` or `mincbuild`

## Usage

After build, run the program in the same way as any other. Either start it from
the command line, or launch it graphically.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit suggestions and bugfixes. Feature / map additions will
probably not be accepted. If you want to make a platformer based on Cubic
Jumping, fork this repository and make your own version.
