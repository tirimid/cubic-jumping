# cubic-jumping

## Introduction

Cubic Jumping is a platformer game. It's called "Cubic Jumping" because you play
as a cube, who jumps - very creative... The game is made with the aim of having
fun movement and level mechanics. Technically speaking, the game is quite
primitive, but I've tried to make the basic features come together in
interesting ways.

## Dependencies

* Make (for build, optional)
* mincbuild (for build, optional)
* SDL2
* `sdl2-config`

## Management

* To build the program, run `make` or `mincbuild`

## Usage

After build, you can run the program in a few ways. To have them listed in your
terminal, run the following:

```
$ ./cubic-jumping help
```

## Contributing

Feel free to submit suggestions and bugfixes. Feature / map additions will
probably not be accepted. If you want to make a platformer based on Cubic
Jumping, fork this repository and make your own version.
